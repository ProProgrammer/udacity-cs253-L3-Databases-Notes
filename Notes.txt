Databases:
	Its a program that stores and retrieves data.
	Particularly: Large amounts of data
	More Particularly: Large amounts of structured data

Tables:
	Made up of columns and rows.

	Columns in database are basically the properties that make up a particular type

	Every entry of data in a table is called a row. Its an instance of an element in the table.

	The ID column is important in almost all tables. Generally every row has an ID and this is how we refer to that row specifically.

Why Databases?
	Downsides of querying data by hand (i.e. writing code by hand that queries the data):
		Error-prone
		Tedious
		Slow
