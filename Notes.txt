Databases:
	Its a program that stores and retrieves data.
	Particularly: Large amounts of data
	More Particularly: Large amounts of structured data

Tables:
	Made up of columns and rows.

	Columns in database are basically the properties that make up a particular type

	Every entry of data in a table is called a row. Its an instance of an element in the table.

	The ID column is important in almost all tables. Generally every row has an ID and this is how we refer to that row specifically.

Why Databases?
	Downsides of querying data by hand (i.e. writing code by hand that queries the data):
		Error-prone
		Tedious
		Slow

	Databases basically exist to take big chunks of data (which could be in millions or billions or even more) and answer queries on them in a reasonable amount of time without having to write a lot of custom code.

Types of Databases:
	1. Relational Databases (SQL):
		Eg: Postgres (used at websites like reddit, hipmunk)
			MySQL (Facebook and a lot more)
			SQLite (which we will use in this class)
				SQLite is a lightweight simple database, not really for working on huge databases but good for light weight work, small databases and learning purposes.
			Oracle
	2. Google App Engine's Datastore (Read about HRD: http://googleappengine.blogspot.in/2011/01/announcing-high-replication-datastore.html)
	3. Amazon Dynamo - 
	4. NoSQL:
		Mongo
		Couch

	In this class we focus on basics of SQL and Google App Engine's Datastore
