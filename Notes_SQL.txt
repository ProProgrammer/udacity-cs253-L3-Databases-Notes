Notes_SQL:
	Its a language for expressing queries

	MySQL, Postgres SQL, SQLite use this language.
	Was invented in 1970s (long before internet/web/web applications existed)

	It was designed to solve problems very much different than the problems we will be solving building consumer web apps

	Eg:
		SELECT * FROM links WHERE id=5;


	Indexes:
		Indexes increase the speed of database reads, That is what they are used for at least.
		Sometimes you don't make the right index, but assuming you make the correct index, your index matches your query, yes, you will increase the speed of your query.

		Indexes however probably decrease the speed of database insers. That is because when we are inserting a new round to our table, we probably also have to update all of our indexes and that takes time.

		Hence, its a tradeoff, we can probably get faster reads at the expense of slower inserts and probably slower writes in general for just updating a row, but there's actually a few perverse cases where an index can actually increase the speed of an update.
